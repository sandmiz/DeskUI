# DeskUI
&emsp;This is my first try of making an UI framework, because I was rebellious and don't wanted to use GTK... well I failed, but I learned a valuable lesson out of this, don't use OpenGL for normal software. This is a library to render squares with textures, and add some sort of primitive interactivity. If you want to continue this project by yourself... I wish you good luck.
